          <span style={{ fontWeight: "520" }}>ISO 800:</span> Necessary for an
          indoor shot at 7 PM, as there was lower light levels so I needed the
          camera to <br /> capture more light. <br />
          <span style={{ fontWeight: "520" }}>24mm focal length:</span> A
          wide-angle allowed me to capture my the face in a way that it fills
          the frame <br />
          without distortion. <br />
          <span style={{ fontWeight: "520" }}>f/1.78 aperture:</span> The wide
          aperture because the setting was indoor and i needed the image to be
          bright enough and such that my face is in focus and the background is
          blur. <br />
          <span style={{ fontWeight: "520" }}>1/50s shutter speed:</span> In
          this case, this shutter speed was sufficient to avoid motion blur
          indoors, given the <br /> low light situation, while maintaining a
          sharp focus on me, the subject.

          To enhance the headshot, I made slight adjustments to the face
          structure to make it appear thinner, <br /> helping emphasize a
          professional yet approachable look. I cleared any spots on my face for
          smoother <br /> skin, ensuring the focus remains on my expression
          without distractions. Since the face was the main <br />
          subject, these edits refined the visual impact, making the portrait
          more polished.

          I opted for a slightly tilted posture with a wide smile to convey
          confidence and flexibilityâ€”important <br />
          traits in a corporate setting. Wearing formal attire, specifically a
          black blazer, ensured that even though <br /> I posed in a fun,
          approachable manner, the overall look remains formal and professional.
          The white background provided a clean contrast, emphasizing the black
          blazer and my facial expression, <br />
          keeping the attention entirely on me.
